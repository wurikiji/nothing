# Practicing Design Patterns

> https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Modern-Approaches-Object-Oriented/dp/1484236025

This repository includes design pattern examples by practicing them
with the programming languages that I am using and studying.

The examples may not fit into design patterns. Issues and Pull Requests are
always welcome. 

## Languages

I would create examples day by day, so it takes time to complete this project.
You can help me to fill this project. I will write a code for the languages
following. But not for all languages because I have only one body to do this. 

- I am used to C, C++, Go, Javascript, Typescript, and Dart.
	- I am comfortable using them, but not an expert/master.
- I know some Java, Python, Kotlin, and Swift. 
	- If I can google, then I am comfortable with them. 
- I am studying Rust. 
	- I can write code for simple CLI apps. I am still learning.
- I have used PHP, Matlab but forgot about them. 
	- I don't have a plan for these languages. 

## Roadmaps 

No raodmaps.
